# Overview

This is a console application built in C# that simulates caring for a virtual pet. The application demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as basic program structure, console I/O, data types, type conversion, and control flow elements.

## Features

1. **Pet Creation:**

    - Allow the user to choose a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit) and give it a name.
    
    - Display a welcome message that includes the pet's type and name.

2. **Pet Care Actions:**

    - **Feeding:** Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
    
    - **Playing:** Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
    
    - **Resting:** Improves health, decreases happiness slightly.
    
    - Each action modifies the pet's stats accordingly and displays a message describing the action's effect.

3. **Pet Status Monitoring:**

    - Track and display petâ€™s stats: hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
    
    - Implement a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.

4. **Time-Based Changes:**

    - Simulating the passage of time, where each action represents the passing of an hour.
    
    - Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction.

5. **Enhanced Interaction Logic:**

    - Implementing consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
    
    - Including special messages or events based on the pet's status like the pet refusing to play if too hungry).

6. **User Interface and Experience:**

    - Develop a simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.
    
    - Include instructions for the user on how to interact with the application
